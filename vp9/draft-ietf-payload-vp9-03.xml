      <t>This memo describes an RTP payload format for the VP9 video codec.
      The payload format has wide applicability, as it supports applications
      from low bit-rate peer-to-peer usage, to high bit-rate video
      conferences.  It includes provisions for temporal and spatial scalability.</t>

    <section anchor="mediaFormatDescription" title="Media Format Description">
      <t>The VP9 codec can maintain up to eight reference frames, of
      which up to three can be referenced or updated by any new frame.</t>

      <t>VP9 also allows a reference frame to be resampled and used as a
      reference for another frame of a different resolution.  This
      allows internal resolution changes without requiring the use of
      key frames.</t>

      <t>These features together enable an encoder to
      implement various forms of coarse-grained scalability,
      including temporal, spatial and quality scalability modes, as
      well as combinations of these, without the need for explicit
      scalable coding tools.</t>

      <t>Temporal layers define different frame rates of video;
      spatial and quality layers define different and possibly dependent
      representations of a single input frame.  Spatial layers allow
      a frame to be encoded at different resolutions, whereas
      quality layers allow a frame to be encoded at the same
      resolution but at different qualities (and thus with different
      amounts of coding error).  VP9 supports quality layers as
      spatial layers without any resolution changes; hereinafter,
      the term "spatial layer" is used to represent both spatial and
      quality layers.</t>

      <t>This payload format specification defines how such
      temporal and spatial scalability layers can be described and 
      communicated.</t>

	  <t>Temporal and spatial scalability layers are associated with
	  non-negative integer IDs. The lowest layer of either type has an
	  ID of 0.</t>

      <t>Layers are designed (and MUST be encoded) such that if
      any layer, and all higher layers, are removed from the bitstream
      along any of the two dimensions, the remaining bitstream is
      still correctly decodable.</t>

      <t>For terminology, this document uses the term "layer frame" to refer
      to a single encoded VP9 frame for a particular resolution/quality, and
      "super frame" to refer to all the representations (layer frames) at a single
      instant in time.  A super frame thus consists of one or more layer frames,
      encoding different spatial layers.</t>

      <t>Within a super frame, a layer frame with spatial layer ID equal to S,
      where S > 0, can depend on a layer frame of the same super frame with a lower spatial layer ID.  This
      "inter-layer" dependency can result in additional coding gain
      compared to the case where only 
      traditional "inter-picture" dependency is used, where a frame depends on previously
      coded frame in time.  For simplicity, this payload format assumes that,
      within a super frame and if inter-layer dependency is used, a spatial layer S frame
      can only depend on spatial layer S-1 frame when S > 0.  Additionally, if
      inter-picture dependency is used, spatial layer S frame is assumed to only
      depend on previously coded spatial layer S frame.</t>

      <t>Given above simplifications for inter-layer and inter-picture
      dependencies, a flag (the D bit described below) is used to indicate whether a
      spatial layer S frame depends on spatial layer S-1 frame.  Given the D bit, a receiver
      only needs to additionally know the inter-picture dependency structure for a given
      spatial layer frame in order to determine its decodability.  Two modes
      of describing the inter-picture dependency structure are possible:
      "flexible mode" and "non-flexible mode".  An encoder can only switch
      between the two on the very first packet of a key frame with temporal 
      layer ID equal to 0.</t>

      <t>In flexible mode, each packet can contain up to 3 reference
      indices, which identify all frames referenced by the frame
      transmitted in the current packet for inter-picture prediction. 
      This (along with the D bit) enables a receiver to identify if a frame 
      is decodable or not and helps it understand the temporal layer
      structure.
      Since this is signaled in 
      each packet it makes it possible to have very flexible temporal layer
      hierarchies and patterns which are changing dynamically.</t>

      <t>In non-flexible mode, the inter-picture dependency (the reference
      indices) of a group of frames (GOF) MUST be pre-specified as part of the 
      scalability structure (SS) data.  In this mode, each 
      packet MUST have an index to refer to one of the described frames
      in the GOF, from which the frames referenced by the frame transmitted in the current packet 
      for inter-picture prediction can be identified.</t>

      <t>The SS data can also be used to specify the resolution of each
      spatial layer present in the VP9 stream for both flexible and non-flexible modes.</t>

          <t>In the non-flexible mode (when the F bit is set to 0), this PID is used

          Additionally, a bit (U) is used to indicate that the current frame is a

      <section anchor="RPSI" title="Reference Picture Selection Indication (RPSI)">
		<t>TODO: Update to indicate which frame within the picture.</t>
        <t>The reference picture selection index is a payload-specific
        feedback message defined within the RTCP-based feedback format. The
        RPSI message is generated by a receiver and can be used in two ways.
        Either it can signal a preferred reference picture when a loss has
        been detected by the decoder -- preferably then a reference that the
        decoder knows is perfect -- or, it can be used as positive feedback
        information to acknowledge correct decoding of certain reference
        pictures. The positive feedback method is useful for VP9 used for
        point to point (unicast) communication. The use of RPSI for VP9 is preferably combined with a special
        update pattern of the codec's two special reference frames -- the
        golden frame and the altref frame -- in which they are updated in an
        alternating leapfrog fashion. When a receiver has received and
        correctly decoded a golden or altref frame, and that frame had a
        PictureID in the payload descriptor, the receiver can acknowledge this
        simply by sending an RPSI message back to the sender. The message body
        (i.e., the "native RPSI bit string" in <xref target="RFC4585"/>) is
        simply the PictureID of the received frame.</t>

        <t>The slice loss indication is another payload-specific feedback
        message defined within the RTCP-based feedback format. The SLI message
        is generated by the receiver when a loss or corruption is detected in
        a frame. The format of the SLI message is as follows <xref
        target="RFC4585"/>:</t>

        <t>Here, First is the macroblock address (in scan order) of the first
        lost block and Number is the number of lost blocks, as defined
        in <xref target='RFC4585'/>. PictureID is the
        six least significant bits of the codec-specific picture identifier in
        which the loss or corruption has occurred. For VP9, this
        codec-specific identifier is naturally the PictureID of the current
        frame, as read from the payload descriptor. If the payload descriptor
        of the current frame does not have a PictureID, the receiver MAY send
        the last received PictureID+1 in the SLI message. The receiver MAY set
        the First parameter to 0, and the Number parameter to the total number
        of macroblocks per frame, even though only part of the frame is
        corrupted. When the sender receives an SLI message, it can make use of
        the knowledge from the latest received RPSI message. Knowing that the
        last golden or altref frame was successfully received, it can encode
        the next frame with reference to that established reference.</t>

		<t><xref target="figureLRRIndexFormat"/> shows the format
		of LRR's layer index field for VP9 streams.  This is
		designed to follow the same layout as the "L" byte
		of the VP9 payload header, which carries the
		stream's layer information.  The "R" and "RES"
		fields MUST be set to 0 on transmission and ingnored on
		reception.  See <xref target="VP9payloadDescriptor"/> for
		details on the T and S fields.</t>

	  <t>Identification of a layer refresh frame can be derived from the
	  reference IDs of each frame by backtracking the dependency chain
	  until reaching a point where only decodable frames are being
	  referenced. Therefore it's recommended for both the
	  flexible and the non-flexible mode that, when upgrade frames are
	  being encoded in response to a LRR, those packets should contain
	  layer indices and the reference fields so that the decoder or an
	  MCU can make this derivation.</t>

	  <t>Example:</t>
	  <t>LRR {1,0}, {2,1} is sent by an MCU when it is currently
	  relaying {1,0} to a receiver and which wants to upgrade to
	  {2,1}. In response the encoder should encode the next frames
	  in layers {1,1} and {2,1} by only referring to frames in
	  {1,0}, or {0,0}.</t>

	  <t>In the non-flexible mode, periodic upgrade frames can be
	  defined by the layer structure of the SS, thus periodic upgrade
	  frames can be automatically identified by the picture ID.</t>

	  SAVPF [RFC5124].  However, as <xref target='RFC7202'>"Securing the RTP Protocol
      Framework: Why RTP Does Not Mandate a Single Media
      Security Solution"</xref> discusses, it is not an RTP payload format's responsibility to
      discuss or mandate what solutions are used to meet the
      basic security goals like confidentiality, integrity and source
      authenticity for RTP in general.  This responsibility lays on
      anyone using RTP in an application.  They can find guidance on available
      security mechanisms in <xref target='RFC7201'>Options for Securing
      RTP Sessions</xref>.  Applications SHOULD use one or more appropriate
      strong security mechanisms.  The rest of this security
      consideration section discusses the security impacting properties of the
      payload format itself.</t>

	  <t>This RTP payload
      format and its media decoder do not exhibit any significant
      non-uniformity in the receiver-side computational complexity for packet
      processing, and thus are unlikely to pose a denial-of-service threat due
      to the receipt of pathological data. Nor does the RTP payload format
      contain any active content.</t>

    <section anchor="congestionControl" title="Congestion Control">
      <t>Congestion control for RTP SHALL be used in accordance with RFC 3550
      <xref target="RFC3550"/>, and with any applicable RTP profile; e.g., RFC
      3551 <xref target="RFC3551"/>. The congestion control mechanism can, in
      a real-time encoding scenario, adapt the transmission rate by
      instructing the encoder to encode at a certain target rate. Media aware
      network elements MAY use the information in the VP9 payload descriptor
      in <xref target="VP9payloadDescriptor"/> to identify non-reference
      frames and discard them in order to reduce network congestion. Note that
      discarding of non-reference frames cannot be done if the stream is
      encrypted (because the non-reference marker is encrypted).</t>
