1.  Introduction

   Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) attempts to find the
   'best' path for connectivity between two peers; in ICE parlance,
   these paths are known as 'candidate pairs'.  During the ICE process,
   one endpoint, known as the 'controlling' endpoint, selects a
   candidate pair as the best pair; this action is known as nomination.
   ICE supports two different mechanisms for performing nomination,
   known as Regular Nomination, and Aggressive Nomination.

   However, each of these modes have flaws that restrict their
   usefulness.  Regular Nomination, as currently speced, requires a best
   pair to be chosen before media transmission can start, causing
   unnecessary call setup delay.  Aggressive Nomination, while avoiding
   this delay, gives the controlling endpoint much less discretion into
   which candidate pair is chosen, preventing it from making decisions
   based on dynamic factors such as RTT or loss rate.  Needless to say,
   the presence of both modes also adds nontrivial complexity.

Internet-Draft                   IceNom                    November 2014


   Lastly, ICE is currently defined as a finite process, where the
   decision on the optimal candidate pair is made during call setup and
   infrequently (if ever) changed.  While this may be acceptable for
   endpoints with static network configurations, it fails to meet the
   needs of mobile endpoints, who may need to seamlessly move between
   networks, or be connected to multiple networks simultaneously.  In
   these cases, the controlling endpoint may want to maintain multiple
   potential candidate pairs, and make dynamic decisions to switch
   between them as conditions change.

   To address these challenges, this document makes two proposals for
   refactoring ICE nomination - merging Regular and Aggressive
   Nomination, and introducing a new mode, known as Continuous
   Nomination.  This makes ICE substantially more flexible without
   increasing complexity.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Goals and Requirements

   The goals for improved ICE nomination are enumerated below.

3.1.  Minimize Call Setup Latency

   Modern ICE agents will often have multiple network interfaces and
   multiple servers from which to obtain ICE candidates.  While some ICE
   checks may succeed quickly, finishing the entire set of checks can
   easily take multiple seconds; this concern is discussed in [RFC5245],
   Section 8.1.1.1.  As a result, ICE endpoints MUST be able to start
   transmitting media immediately upon a successful ICE check, and MUST
   retain the ability to switch if a better candidate pair becomes
   available later.

3.2.  Allow Controlling Endpoint to Make Dynamic Decisions

   While an ICE endpoint will assign various priority values to its ICE
   candidates, these priorities are static and can only be based on a
   priori knowledge; the shortcomings of this approach are discussed in
   the first paragraph of Section 2.6 in [RFC5245].  To properly make
   choices in multi-network and multi-server scenarios, the controlling
   endpoint MUST be able to make dynamic decisions about the selected
   candidate pair based on observed network performance.  For example,
   RTT could be used to evaluate which TURN servers to use, as described
   in [I-D.williams-peer-redirect] To ensure symmetric flows, this

Internet-Draft                   IceNom                    November 2014


   implies that the controlling endpoint MUST be able to communicate its
   choice to the controlled side.

3.3.  Allow Selected Pair Change At Any Time Without Signaling

   Expanding on the requirement above, the need to make dynamic
   decisions is not limited to call setup.  A multihomed endpoint may
   need to switch interfaces based on mobility considerations, or a
   robust endpoint may want to keep multiple network paths warm and
   switch immediately if connectivity is interrupted on one of them.  As
   the signaling channel may be affected by the event necessitating the
   switch, this implies that the controlling endpoint MUST be able to
   change the selected pair and indicate this to the remote side without
   signaling.  The need for this functionality has been stated in
   [I-D.wing-mmusic-ice-mobility] and [I-D.singh-avtcore-mprtp].

   The rules in [RFC5245] ensure that the controlled endpoint keeps its
   candidate needed for the selected pair alive.  However, in order for
   alternate pairs to remain available, the controlled endpoint must
   keep the associated candidates alive as well, following the
   procedures outlined in [RFC5245], Section 4.1.1.4.  This implies that
   the controlling endpoint MUST have some way to indicate to the
   controlled side that specific candidates are to be kept alive.

3.4.  Allow Continuous Addition of Candidates

   In certain network mobility scenarios, networks may come up and down
   while the call is active.  In order to allow candidates gathered on
   newly available networks to be used for the selected pair or backup
   pairs, the endpoint MUST be able to gather candidates on these
   networks and communicate them to the remote side.  While this could
   be done using an ICE restart, as described in [RFC5245], Section 9.1,
   the ICE restart may have unintended consequences, such as causing the
   remote side to regather all candidates.  Instead, it would be best if
   the new candidates could be trickled, as discussed in
   [I-D.ietf-mmusic-trickle-ice], but even after ICE processing has
   completed.

3.5.  Maintain Backwards Compatibility

   To prevent interoperability problems, ICE endpoints that support the
   functionality listed above MUST still maintain [RFC5245] compliance
   when interacting with existing endpoints.  However, the ideal
   solution SHOULD allow some improvements to occur when only the
   controlling side supports the new functionality.

3.6.  Minimize Complexity Increase

   Increased functionality typically leads to increased complexity,
   which leads to more edge cases, and more implementation bugs.  This
   suggests that in addition to proposing new ICE functionality, the
   ideal solution SHOULD deprecate superfluous functionality.

4.  Deprecating Aggressive Nomination

4.1.  Overview

   The main benefits of Regular Nomination are that the controlling side
   can dynamically choose which candidate pair to use, and a clear
   signal when the nomination process has completed, via the presence of
   the USE-CANDIDATE flag in a Binding Request.  The main benefit of
   Aggressive Nomination is that it is only necessary to send a single
   Binding Request before starting the transmission of media, reducing
   setup latency.  Why don't we have both?

   By preserving the dynamic behavior of Regular Nomination, but
   allowing media transmission to start upon a single successful
   connectivity check, as in Aggressive Nomination, the requirements of
   Section 3.1 and Section 3.2 can be met, while meeting the
   compatibility requirement from Section 3.5 and, since Aggressive
   Nomination is no longer needed, the complexity requirement from
   Section 3.6.

4.2.  Operation

   Since media may be transmitted as soon as all components have a valid
   pair, as indicated in [RFC5245], Page 69, an ICE Agent can begin
   transmitting media as soon as this occurs, even if it has not sent a
   Binding Request with USE-CANDIDATE.

   This pair can change as more pairs are added to the Valid list on the
   controlling side.  When nomination completes, and a final pair is
   selected, this is communicated to the controlled side via the typical
   Binding Request with USE-CANDIDATE.

   On the controlled side, the same process can occur, with the ICE
   Agent transmitting media as soon as a valid pair exists.  To
   encourage use of symmetric RTP, the controlled ICE Agent SHOULD use
   the same candidate pair on which it received media from the
   controlling side.  [Doesn't need to be secure media, since the
   controlling side will finalize this preference through USE-CANDIDATE
   shortly.]

Internet-Draft                   IceNom                    November 2014


   As this is legal ICE behavior, no negotiation of this mechanism
   should be needed.  In the event the receiver drops any packets that
   arrive before a Binding Request with USE-CANDIDATE set, this will
   simply lead to brief media clipping and will resolve itself once
   nomination completes.

4.3.  Backwards Compatibility

   When acting in the controlled role, new implementations MUST NOT use
   Aggressive Nomination.

   When acting in the controlled role, and the controlling side is using
   Aggressive Nomination (e.g. sending USE-CANDIDATE in its initial
   Binding Requests), the standard PRIORITY-based mechanism outlined in
   [RFC5245], Section 8.1.1.2 should be used to determine the reverse
   media path.

   Note that if implementations would prefer to just avoid Aggressive
   Nomination altogether, they MAY indicate some TBD pseudo-option in
   the ice-options attribute.  Because compliant implementations MUST
   NOT use Aggressive Nomination if an unknown ICE option is
   encountered, this effectively prohibits the use of Aggressive
   Nomination.  [N.B. this could be the ice-options:continuous option
   described below]

5.  Introducing Continuous Nomination

5.1.  Overview

   As discussed above, in mobile environments there can be multiple
   possible valid candidate pairs, and these can change at various
   points in the call, as new interfaces go up and down, signal strength
   for wireless interfaces changes, and new relay servers are
   discovered.

   However, under 5245 rules, once a candidate pair is selected and
   confirmed, via USE-CANDIDATE, nomination has completed and cannot be
   restarted without performing an ICE restart.  This is overly complex
   in many cases, and especially problematic in some specific ones,
   namely a wifi-cellular handover, where the signaling path for
   communicating an ICE restart may be impacted by the handover.

   To address this situation, this section introduces the concept of
   "continuous nomination", where the controlling ICE endpoint can
   adjust the selected candidate pair at any time.  By allowing ICE
   processing to occur continuously during a call, rather than just at
   call setup, the requirements expressed in Section 3.3 and Section 3.4
   can be met.

5.2.  Operation

   Under continuous nomination, ICE never concludes; new candidates can
   always be trickled, and a new candidate pair can be selected by the
   controlling side at any time.

   When selecting a new candidate pair, the controlling side informs the
   controlled side of the chosen pat by sending a new Binding Request
   with a USE-CANDIDATE attribute.  The decision about which candidate
   pair to use is fully dynamic; the controlling side can use metrics
   such as RTT or loss rate to change the selected pair at any time.  If
   Binding Requests need to be sent for any other reason, such as
   consent checks [TODO: reference], any checks sent on the selected
   pair MUST include a USE-CANDIDATE attribute.

   Upon receipt of a Binding Request with USE-CANDIDATE, the controlled
   side MUST switch its media path to the candidate pair on which the
   Binding Request was received.

   During continuous nomination, the controlling side may still elect to
   prune certain candidate pairs; for example, an implementation may
   choose to drop relay candidates once a successful connection has been
   established.  The controlled side, however, should follow the
   controlling side's lead in terms of deciding whether any pairs should
   be pruned.  The controlling ICE Agent informs the remote side of its
   preferences by continuing to send Binding Requests to the remote side
   on each candidate pair that it wants to retain.  The controlled ICE
   Agent SHOULD prune any candidate pairs that have not received a
   Binding Request in N seconds (30?), and SHOULD NOT keep alive any
   candidates that are not associated with a live candidate pair.
   [TODO: decide if this implicit timeout approach is correct, or if we
   should have some sort of approach similar to TURN LIFETIME indicating
   when a pair should be GCed, with LIFETIME==0 indicating immediate
   GC.]  One side benefit of doing this is that the continuous exchange
   of Binding Requests across all candidate pairs allows the RTT and
   loss rate for each to be reliably determined and kept up to date.

   If the endpoints have negotiated Trickle ICE support [TODO:
   reference], and new candidates become available on either side, the
   endpoint may send these candidates to the remote side using the
   existing Trickle ICE mechanisms.  Once all of the new candidates have
   been transmitted, the endpoint MUST send an end-of-candidates
   messages, which indicates that no more candidates will be sent in the
   near future.

   At any point, either side may perform an ICE restart, which will
   result in both sides gathering new ICE candidates, starting a new

   continuous nomination sequence, and upon successful completion,
   discarding all candidates from the previous nomination sequence.

5.3.  Backwards Compatibility

   Since standard ICE implementations may not expect the selected pair
   to change after a USE-CANDIDATE attribute is received, support for
   continuous nomination is explicitly indicated via a new "continuous"
   value for ice-options.  If the remote side does not support the
   "continuous" option, the controlling side MUST fall back to Regular
   Nomination, as specified in [RFC5245], Sectiom 8.1.1.
